    <h2>WHERE WE STARTED</h2>
    <div id="about">
      <p>Kingdom Children Intercessor Online Bible School for kids started as a small group of prayer meeting in 2019 interceding for all Children and later became a ministry in 2022 after receiving instruction from the Lord. 

        Since then we have consistently  and passionately with the help of the Holy Spirit pray for all Children regardless of their religion and ethnicity. 
        
        We believe that raising Godly Children is not only in praying but also teaching, thereby giving birth to this online Bible school. </p>
